Customer Lifetime Value Analysis is a metric that measures the total net value a customer will bring to a business from the beginning to the end of their relationship. This analysis helps businesses better understand their customers, optimize marketing strategies, and increase profitability.

## Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:

There are several methods to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). The most basic formula is as follows:

CLV= Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan

### Components:

1. Average Order Value (AOV): The average amount a customer spends per purchase.

2. Purchase Frequency: The number of times a customer makes a purchase within a given period.

3. Customer Lifespan: The average time a customer remains in a relationship with the business. For example, 9 months, 2 years etc.
